\title{Tools to Quickly and Neatly Summarize Data}
\description{
\pkg{summarytools} provides users with functions to neatly and quickly
summarize numerical and categorical data. Data frame summaries, frequency
tables and cross-tabulations, as well as common descriptive (univariate)
statistics can be produced in a straightforward manner. Users with little to
no prior R programming experience but who are familiar with popular commercial
statistical software such as SAS, SPSS and Stata should feel right at home.
}
\details{
These are the four core functions: 
\describe{
  \item{dfSummary}{Extensive yet legible data frame summaries.}
  \item{freq}{Frequency tables supporting weights and displaying proportions
  of valid and of total data, including cumulative proportions.}
  \item{descr}{All common univariate descriptive stats for single vectors
     or for all numerical vectors in a data frame.}
  \item{ctable}{Cross-tabulations for two categorical vectors or factors.
    Choose between \emph{Total}, \emph{Columns} or \emph{Rows} proportions.}
}

\strong{Output formats} are:
 \describe{
   \item{plain ascii}{Ideal when looking at results in the console.}
   \item{rmarkdown}{Ideal when writing short papers or presentations.}
   \item{html}{This format is well integrated in RStudio (but will
   work with any browser). Use the \code{view()} function to see results
   appear directly in RStudio's Viewer or in your default Web
   Browser.}
 }
