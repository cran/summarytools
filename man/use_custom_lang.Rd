\description{
If your language is not available or if you wish to customize the outputs'
language to suit your preference, you can set up a translations file (see
details) and import it with this function.
}
\details{
To build the translations file, copy the 
\emph{language_template.csv} file located in the installed 
package's \emph{includes} directory and fill out the \sQuote{custom} column
using a text editor, leaving column titles unchanged. The file must also
retain its \emph{UTF-8} encoding.
