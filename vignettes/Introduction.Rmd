*summarytools* is an [R](http://r-project.org) package providing tools to _neatly and quickly summarize data_. Its main purpose is to provide functions that many R programmers once wished were included in base R. It also aims at making _R_ a little easier to use for newcomeRs. With a few lines of very simple code, one can get a pretty good first look at the data at hand.

An emphasis has been put on both _what_ and _how_ results are presented, so that the package can serve both as a data exploration tool and a reporting tool than can be used either on its own for minimal reports, or integrated in a larger set of tools such as _RStudio_'s very good _rmarkdown_ support.

## The Three Main Functions

The package is built around three key functions:

- **`freq()` -- _Frequency tables_** with proportions, cumulative proportions and missing data information
- **`descr()` -- _Descriptive (univariate) statistics_** for numerical vectors which is more thorough than `fivenum()` and other similar functions
- **`dfSummary()` -- _Dataframe summaries_** that facilitate data cleaning and firsthand evaluation

## Output Options

All _summarytools_ objects returned by the main functions can be:

- Displayed as plain text in the console (default behavior)
- Redirected to plain text, _markdown_ or HTML documents by using the `file=` argument
- Rendered to HTML and shown in default Web Browser or in _RStudio_'s Viewer via the `print()` or `view()` functions

## Additional Features

- Both `freq()` and `descr()` support **sampling weights**
- The three main functions support **variable labels** (`Hmisc::label`) 
- The package also includes a utility function called `what.is()` which combines results from functions such as `class()`, `attributes()`, `typeof()` and others to give an extensive description of an object's properties. It also checks the object against most `is.` functions and returns the list of matching elements. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(comment=NA, prompt=TRUE, cache=FALSE)
```

## Bare-Bones Example

To show what default (console) outputs look like, we first generate a frequency table for `iris$Species`.

```{r barebones}
freq(iris$Species)
```

To get familiar with the output styles, one can try different values for `style=` and see how results look in the console. 

## Markdown-Powered Outputs

When using `style='rmarkdown'` with `freq()` or `descr()`, the generated outputs are ready for markdown rendering. With `dfSummary()`, options for `style` are "multiline" (default) and "grid", and `plain.ascii=FALSE` must be used to have proper line feeds in multiline cells.

_Note:_ If building a document using an .Rmd document with _knitr_, always set the chunk option `results` to "asis":

> \`\`\`{r example, results='asis'}  
> library(summarytools)  
> data(tobacco)  
> dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii=FALSE)  
> \`\`\`


### Descriptive (Univariate) Statistics With `descr()`

This function accepts both vectors and dataframes, in which case it will show statistics for all numerical variables in the dataframe. We'll use one of the datasets included with the package.

```{r descr_md, results='asis'}
data(exams)
descr(exams, style='rmarkdown')
```

To rather see variables in rows and stats in columns, we use `transpose=TRUE`:

```{r descr_md2, eval=FALSE}
descr(exams, style = 'rmarkdown', transpose = TRUE)
```


### Dataframe Summaries With `dfSummary()`

This is probably the most time-saving function I have ever written... For this one, we can use styles "multiline" (default) or "grid". We **must** however specify `plain.ascii=FALSE` when using markdown, otherwise the rendered results will be problematic.

```{r dfsum_md, results='asis'}
data(tobacco)
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE)
```

Using "grid" adds space between cells...
```{r dfsum_mdgrid, results='asis'}
dfSummary(tobacco, style = 'grid', plain.ascii = FALSE)
```


## Redirecting Output

### Text/Markdown Documents

With the `file=` parameter, we can redirect output into text files. And setting `append=TRUE` will append results to an existing text file:

```{r redir, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, file="tobacco.txt", style = "grid")  # Creates tobacco.txt
descr(tobacco, file="tobacco.txt", append = TRUE)  # Appends results to tobacco.txt
```

### HTML Documents

_summarytools_ uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)'s stylesheets to generate standalone HTML documents that can be displayed in a Web Browser or in _RStudio_'s Viewer using the generic `print()` function:

```{r view_html, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), method = "browser")  # Displays results in default Web Browser
print(dfSummary(tobacco), method = "viewer")   # Displays results in RStudio's Viewer
view(dfSummary(tobacco))                       # Same as line above -- view() is a wrapper function
```

Using `file=` argument with an .html extension will simply generate an HTML document (without opening it).

```{r create_html, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, file = "~/Documents/tobacco_summary.html")
```

Resulting document:

<img src="dfSummary.png" alt="dfSummary in HTML format" style="width: 680px;"/>

#### Removing Temporary Files With `cleartmp()`
When calling `print()` or `view()`, a temporary HTML file is created in R's temporary directory. To delete the last such file, use `cleartmp()`; to remove all temporary files generated in the Session, use `cleartmp('all')`.


## Getting Most Properties of an Object With `what.is()`

When developing, we often use a number functions to obtain an object's properties. `what.is()` proposes to lump together the results of such functions (`class()`, `typeof()`, `attributes()` and others).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
what.is(iris)
```

### Final note
The source of this document is an .Rmd file; _knitr_'s chunk option `results` has been set to `'asis'`, to make sure formatting is not coming from _knitr_ itself.
