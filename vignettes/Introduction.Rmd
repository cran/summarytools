# 1. Overview

**summarytools** provides a coherent set of functions centered on data exploration
and simple reporting. At its core reside the following four functions:

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
txt <- data.frame(
  Function = 
    c('<a href="#freq">freq()</a>',
      '<a href="#ctable">ctable()</a>',
      '<a href="#descr">descr()</a>',
      '<a href="#dfsummary">dfSummary()</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;'),
  Description = 
    c("**Frequency Tables** featuring counts, proportions, as well as missing data information",
      paste("**Cross-Tabulations** (joint frequencies) between pairs of discrete/categorical variables,",
            "featuring marginal sums as well as row, column or total proportions"),
      paste("**Descriptive (Univariate) Statistics** for numerical data, featuring common measures of",
            "central tendency and dispersion"),
      paste("Extensive **Data Frame Summaries** featuring type-specific information for all variables",
            "in a data frame: univariate statistics and/or frequency distributions, bar charts or",
            "histograms, as well as missing data counts and proportions. Very useful to quickly",
            "detect anomalies and identify trends at a glance"))
)

kable(txt, format = "html", escape = FALSE, align = c('l', 'l')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, monospace = TRUE, border_right = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "28em")
```

## 1.1 Motivation

The package was developed with the following objectives in mind:

 - Provide a coherent set of easy-to-use descriptive functions that are
   akin to those included in commercial statistical software suites such as
   SAS, SPSS, and Stata 
 - Offer flexibility in terms of output format & content  
 - Integrate well with commonly used software & tools for reporting
   ([the RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/),
   [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/))
   while also allowing for standalone, simple report generation from any R
   interface

## 1.2 Redirecting Outputs

Results can be

 - Displayed in the *R* console as plain text  
 - Rendered as *html* and shown in a Web browser or in RStudio's Viewer pane
 - Written to, or appended to plain text, *markdown*, or *html* files

## 1.3 Other Characteristics

 - **Pipe-Friendly**:  
   + The `%>%` and `%$%` operators from 
     the [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr) package are supported  
   + The `%>>%` operator from the [pipeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pipeR)
     package is also supported  
 - **Multilingual**:  
   + Built-in translations exist for French, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Turkish  
   + Users can easily add custom translations or modify existing sets of
     translations as needed  
 - **Weights-enabled**: except for `dfSummary()`, all core functions support sampling 
   weights 
 - **Flexible**: 
   + Default values for most function arguments can be modified using `st_options()`;
     this simplifies coding and minimizes redundancy 
   + [**Pander options**](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/) can be used for text /
     markdown tables
   + Base R's `format()` parameters are supported; this is especially useful to set thousands
     separators, among several other possibilities
   + [**Bootstrap CSS**](https://getbootstrap.com/) used by default with *html*
     outputs, and user-defined classes can be added at will

# 2. The Four Core Functions 

## <a id="freq"></a>2.1 Frequency Tables With freq()

The `freq()` function generates frequency tables with counts,
proportions, as well as missing data information.

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

In this first example, the `plain.ascii` and `style` arguments were
specified. However, since we have defined them globally for this document
using `st_options()`, they are redundant and will be omitted from hereon.
See <a href="#setup">section 13</a> for more details on this vignette's
configuration.

### 2.1.1 Formatting Numbers With `format()`'s Arguments

As of version 0.9.8, it is possible to use base R's [`format()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/format) 
parameters when calling `freq()` or any other core function.

Some of the most useful are **big.mark**, which inserts thousands separators, and **decimal.mark**,
which allows using commas instead of dots as decimal separator (useful in several locales). Note that
decimal marks can also be set globally with the R option *OutDec* (*e.g.* `options(OutDec = ",")`).

The formatting is applied in the heading section as well as in the results tables:

```{r}
set.seed(2835)
Random_numbers <- sample(c(5e3, 5e4, 5e5), size = 1e4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.12, .36, .52))
freq(Random_numbers, big.mark = ",", cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)

# We can also use format() arguments with print / view
print(freq(Random_numbers, cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE), big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ".")
```
 

### 2.1.2 Ignoring Missing Data

The `report.nas` argument can be set to `FALSE` in order to
ignore missing values (*NA*'s). Doing so has the following
effects on the resulting table:

 1. The **\<NA\>** row is omitted  
 2. The **% Total** and **% Total Cum.** (cumulative) columns are also omitted  
 3. The **% Valid** column simply becomes **%**  
 4. The **% Valid Cum.** column simply becomes **% Cum.**  

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

Note that the `headings = FALSE` parameter suppresses the heading section. (The
heading section consists of a title, as well as various metadata elements: object
names, labels, by-groups, and so on.

### 2.1.3 Minimal Frequency Tables

By "switching off" all optional elements, a much simpler table will be produced:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, 
     cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

### 2.1.4 Multiple Frequency Tables

To generate frequency tables for all variables in a data frame, one *could* use
`lapply()`. However, this is not required since `freq()` handles whole data
frames, too:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco)
```

To avoid cluttering the results, *numerical* columns having more
than 25 distinct values are ignored. This threshold of 
25 can be changed by using `st_options()`; for example, to change it to 10,
we'd use `st_options(freq.ignore.threshold = 10)`.

**Note**: the *tobacco* data frame contains simulated data and is
included in the package. Another simulated data frame is included: *exams*.
Both have French versions (*tabagisme*, *examens*).

### 2.1.5 Subsetting (Filtering) Frequency Tables

The `rows` parameter allows subsetting frequency tables; we can
use this parameter in different ways:

 - To filter rows by their order of appearance, we use a numerical vector;
   `rows = 1:10` will show the frequencies for the first 10 values only 
 - To filter rows by name, we can use  
   + a character vector specifying the exact row names
     we wish to keep in the results  
   + a single character string which will be used as a
     regular expression to select the matching column(s);
     see `?regex` for more information on regular expressions  

Used in combination with the `order` argument, the subsetting feature
can be quite practical. For a character variable containing a large number
of distinct values, showing only the most frequent is easily done:

```{r}
freq(tobacco$disease, order = "freq", rows = 1:5, headings = FALSE)
```

Instead of `"freq"`, we can use `"-freq"` to reverse the ordering and
get results ranked from lowest to highest in frequency. 

To account for the frequencies of unshown values, the "**(Other)**" row is
automatically added.

### 2.1.6 Collapsible Sections

When generating *html* results, use the `collapse = TRUE` argument with
`print()` or `view()` to get collapsible sections; clicking on the variable
name in the heading section will collapse / reveal the frequency table (results
not shown).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(freq(tobacco), collapse = TRUE)
```

## <a id="ctable"></a>2.2 Cross-Tabulations with ctable()

`ctable()` generates cross-tabulations (joint frequencies) for
pairs of categorical variables. 

Since *markdown* does not support multiline table headings
(but does accept *html* code), we'll use the *html* rendering
feature for this section.

Using the *tobacco* data frame, we'll cross-tabulate the two
categorical variables *smoker* and *diseased*.

```{r}
print(ctable(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"),
      method = "render")
```

### 2.2.1 Row, Column or Total Proportions

Row proportions are shown by default. To display *column* or *total*
proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`, respectively. To omit
proportions altogether, use `prop = "n"`.

### 2.2.2 Minimal Cross-Tabulations

By "switching off" all optional features, we get a simple “2 x 2” table:

```{r}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(x = smoker, y = diseased, prop = 'n',
                  totals = FALSE, headings = FALSE),
           method = "render"))
```

### 2.2.3 Chi-Square (&#120536;<sup>2</sup>), Odds Ratio and Risk Ratio

To display the chi-square statistic, set `chisq = TRUE`. For
*2 x 2* tables, use `OR` and `RR` to show odds ratio and
risk ratio (also called relative risk), respectively. Those can
be set to `TRUE`, in which case 95% confidence intervals will be
shown; to use alternate confidence levels, use for example `OR = .90`.

To show how pipes can be used with **summarytools**, we'll
use **magrittr**'s `%$%` and `%>%` operators:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
tobacco %$%  # Acts like with(tobacco, ...)
  ctable(smoker, diseased,
         chisq = TRUE, OR = TRUE, RR = TRUE,
         headings = FALSE) %>%
  print(method = "render")
```

<br/>

## <a id="descr"></a>2.3 Descriptive Statistics With descr()

`descr()` generates descriptive / univariate statistics, *i.e.* common central
tendency statistics and measures of dispersion. It accepts single
vectors as well as data frames; in the latter case, all non-numerical columns
are ignored, with a message to that effect. 

```{r}
descr(iris)
```

### 2.3.1 Transposing and Selecting Statistics

Results can be transposed by using `transpose = TRUE`, and statistics
can be selected using the `stats` argument:

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd"), transpose = TRUE, headings = FALSE)
```

See `?descr` for a list of all available statistics. Special values 
“all”, “fivenum”, and “common” are also valid values for the `stats`
argument. The default value is “all”.

<br/>

## <a id="dfsummary"></a>2.4 Data Frame Summaries With dfSummary() 

`dfSummary()` creates a summary table with statistics, frequencies and graphs
for all variables in a data frame. The information displayed is
type-specific (character, factor, numeric, date) and also varies according to
the number of distinct values.

To see the results in RStudio's Viewer (or in the default Web browser if
working in another IDE or from a terminal window), we use the `view()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
<img src="dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png" width=100% style="border:0" />

### 2.4.1 Using dfSummary() in Rmarkdown Documents

When using `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents, it is generally a good 
idea to exclude a column or two to avoid margin overflow. Since the *Valid*
and *Missing* columns are redundant, we can drop either one of them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", 
          graph.magnif = 0.75, valid.col = FALSE, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp")
```
<img src="dfSummary_md.png" width=100%/>

**The `tmp.img.dir` parameter is mandatory** when generating *dfSummaries* in
*Rmarkdown* documents, except for *html* rendering. The 
explanation for this can be found [further below](#tmp-img-dir). 

### 2.4.2 Advanced Features

The `dfSummary()` function also

 - Reports the number of duplicate records in the heading section  
 - Detects UPC/EAN codes (barcode numbers) and doesn't calculate irrelevant
   statistics for them  
 - Detects email addresses and reports counts of valid, invalid and
   duplicate addresses  

### 2.4.3 Excluding Columns

Although most columns can be excluded using the function's parameters, it
is also possible to delete them with the following syntax (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfs <- dfSummary(iris)
dfs$Variable <- NULL # This deletes the "Variable" column
```

<br/>

# 3. Grouped Statistics Using stby()

To produce optimal results, **summarytools** has its own version of
the base `by()` function. It's called `stby()`, and we use it exactly as we
would `by()`:

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = "common", transpose = TRUE))
```

## 3.1 Special Case of descr() with stby()

When used to produce split-group statistics for a single variable, `stby()`
assembles everything into a single table instead of displaying a series
of one-column tables.

```{r}
with(tobacco, stby(data = BMI, INDICES = age.gr, 
                   FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
```

## 3.2 Using stby() With ctable()

The syntax is a little trickier for this combination, so here is an example
(results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), 
     INDICES = tobacco$gender, FUN = ctable)

# or equivalently
with(tobacco, 
     stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), 
          INDICES = gender, FUN = ctable))
```

<br/>

# 4. Grouped Statistics Using dplyr::group_by()

To create grouped statistics with `freq()`, `descr()` or `dfSummary()`, it is
possible to use **dplyr**'s `group_by()` as an alternative to `stby()`. Syntactic
differences aside, one key distinction is that `group_by()` considers
`NA` values on the grouping variable(s) as a valid category, albeit with a warning
message suggesting the use of `forcats::fct_explicit_na` to make `NA`'s explicit
in factors. Following this advice, we get:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(magrittr)
tobacco$gender %<>% forcats::fct_explicit_na()
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

<br/>

# 5. Creating Tidy Tables With tb()

When generating `freq()` or `descr()` tables, it is possible to turn the
results into "tidy" tables with the use of the `tb()` function (think of
*tb* as a diminutive for *tibble*). For example:

```{r, results='markup'}
library(magrittr)
iris %>% descr(stats = "common") %>% tb()
iris$Species %>% freq(cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE) %>% tb()
```

By definition, no total rows are part of *tidy* tables, and the row
names are converted to a regular column. Note that for displaying
*tibbles* using *Rmarkdown*, the **knitr** chunk option 'results'
should be set to "markup" instead of "asis".

## 5.1 Tidy Split-Group Statistics

Here are some examples showing how lists created using `stby()` or `group_by()` can
be transformed into *tidy tibbles*.

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr <- stby(data = exams, INDICES = exams$gender, 
                      FUN = descr, stats = "common")
grouped_descr %>% tb()
```

The `order` parameter controls row ordering:
```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 2)
```

Setting `order = 3` changes the order of the sort variables exactly as with
`order = 2`, but it also reorders the columns:

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 3)
```

For more details, see `?tb`.

## 5.2 A Bridge to Other Packages 

**summarytools** objects are not always compatible with packages
focused on table formatting, such as
[formattable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=formattable) or
[kableExtra](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kableExtra).
However, `tb()` can be used as a "bridge", an intermediary step
turning `freq()` and `descr()` objects into simple tables that any
package can work with. Here is an example using **kableExtra**:

```{r, results='asis'}
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
stby(iris, iris$Species, descr, stats = "fivenum") %>%
  tb(order = 3) %>%
  kable(format = "html", digits = 2) %>%
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top")
```

<br/>

# 6. Redirecting Output to Files

Using the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()`, we can write outputs
to a file, be it *html*, *Rmd*, *md*, or just plain text (*txt*). The file
extension is used to determine the type of content to write out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.md")
```

**A Note About *PDF* documents**

There is no direct way to create a *PDF* file with **summarytools**. One option is
to generate an *html* file and convert it to *PDF* using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
or [WK\<html\>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html) (the latter gives better results
than Pandoc with `dfSummary()` output). Another option is to create an *Rmd* document
using *PDF* as the output format, but with a caveat: displaying graphs with `dfSummary()`
will cause vertical misalignment (we hope to resolve this issue in a future version).

## 6.1 Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if we wish to include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating an *Rmd*
document.

st_options(style = 'rmarkdown',   # Set the value of one or several options
           footnote = NA)         # Turn off the footnote for all html output
```

# 8. Overriding Formatting Attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, we can override most of them when using
`print()` or `view()`.

## 8.1 Overriding Function-Specific Arguments

This table indicates what arguments can be used with `print()`
or `view()` to override formatting attributes. Base R's `format()`
function arguments also apply, even though they are not reproduced here.


| Argument         | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| ---------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| style            |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |

## 8.2 Overriding Heading Contents

To change the information shown in the heading section,
use the following arguments with `print()` or `view()`:

| Argument           | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -----------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| Data.frame         |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Data.frame.label   |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Variable           |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| Variable.label     |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| Group              |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| date               |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Weights            |   x    |        |   x   |           |
| Data.type          |   x    |        |       |           |
| Row.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |
| Col.variable       |        |   x    |       |           |


### Example

In the following example, we will create and display a `freq()` object, and
then display it again, this time overriding three of its formatting attributes,
as well as one heading attribute.

```{r}
(age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)) 
print(age_stats, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, display.type = FALSE,
      Variable.label = "Age Group")
```

## 8.3 Order of Priority for Parameters / Options

1.  `print()` or `view()` parameters have precedence (overriding feature)  
2.  `freq() / ctable() / descr() / dfSummary()` parameters come second  
3.  Global options set with `st_options()` come third and act as default

# 9. Fine-Tuning Looks with CSS

When creating *html* reports, both [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)'s 
*CSS* and *summarytools.css* are included by default. For greater control
on the looks of *html* content, it is also possible to add class
definitions in a custom *CSS* file. 

### Example

We need to use a very small font size for a simple *html*
report containing a `dfSummary()`. For this, we create a
*.css* file (with the name of our choosing) which contains
the following class definition:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

Then we use `print()`'s `custom.css` argument to specify to location of
our newly created *CSS* file (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
      table.classes = 'tiny-text', file = "tiny-tobacco-dfSummary.html")
```

# 10. Creating *Shiny* apps

To successfully include **summarytools** functions in *Shiny* apps,

 - use *html* rendering  
 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - set `headings = FALSE` in case problems arise  
 - adjust graph sizes with `print()`'s `graph.magnif` parameter or
   with the `dfSummary.graph.magnif` global option  
 - if `dfSummary()` tables are too wide, omit a column or two (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`,
   for instance)  
 - if the results are still unsatisfactory, set column widths manually with `print()`'s
   `col.widths` parameter  

**Example** (results not shown)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, varnumbers = FALSE, valid.col = FALSE, 
                graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

# 11. Graphs in Markdown dfSummaries {#tmp-img-dir}

When using `dfSummary()` in an *Rmd* document using *markdown*
styling (as opposed to *html* rendering), three elements are
needed in order to display the *png* graphs properly:

  1 - `plain.ascii` must be set to FALSE  
  2 - `style` must be set to "grid"  
  3 - `tmp.img.dir` must be defined  

Why the third element? Although *R* makes it really easy to 
create temporary files and directories, they do have long pathnames,
especially on Windows. Unfortunately, Pandoc determines the final
(rendered) column widths by counting characters in a cell, 
even if those characters are paths pointing to images.

At this time, there seems to be only one solution around this problem:
cut down on characters in image paths. So instead of this:
```
+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable  | Graph                                                               | Valid   |
+===========+=====================================================================+=========+
| gender\   | ![](C:/Users/johnny/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpYRgetx/file5aa44d71.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]  |                                                                     | (97.8%) |
+----+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

...we aim for this:
```
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
| Variable      | Graph                | Valid   |
+===============+======================+=========+
| gender\       | ![](/tmp/ds0001.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]      |                      | (97.8%) |
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
```

CRAN policies are really strict when it comes to writing content in 
the user directories, or anywhere outside *R's temporary zone* (for good 
reasons). So the users need to set this location themselves,
therefore consenting to having content written outside 
*R*'s predefined temporary zone.

On Mac OS and Linux, using "/tmp" makes a lot of sense: it's a short path,
and it's self-cleaning. On Windows, there is no such convenient directory, so
we need to pick one -- be it absolute ("/tmp") or relative ("img",
or simply "."). Two things are to be kept in mind: it needs to be short
(5 characters max) and it needs to be cleaned up manually.

# 12. Translations

Thanks to the *R* community's efforts, the following languages can be used,
in addition to English (default):
French (*fr*), Portuguese (*pt*), Russian (*ru*), Spanish (*es*),
and Turkish (*tr*).

To switch languages, simply use 

```{r}
st_options(lang = "fr")
```

All output from the core functions will now use that language:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species)
```

## 12.1 Non-UTF-8 Locales

On most Windows systems, it will be necessary to change the `LC_CTYPE` element
of the locale settings if the character set is not included in the system's
default locale. For instance, in order to get good results with the Russian
language in a "latin1" environment, we need to do the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "russian")
st_options(lang = 'ru')
```

Then to go back to default settings:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "")
st_options(lang = "en")
```

## 12.2 Defining and Using Custom Translations

Using the function `use_custom_lang()`, it is possible to add your own set of 
translations. To achieve this, get the 
[csv template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv),
customize the +/- 70 items, and call `use_custom_lang()`, giving it as
sole argument the path to the edited *csv* template. Note that such
custom translations will not persist across R sessions. This means that
you should always have this *csv* file handy for future use.

## 12.3 Defining Specific Keywords

Sometimes, all you might want to do is change just a few keywords -- for instance,
you could prefer using "N" instead of "Freq" in the title row of `freq()` tables. 
For this, use `define_keywords()`. Calling this function without any arguments will
bring up, on systems that support graphical devices (the vast majority, that is),
an editable window allowing to modify only the desired item(s).

<img src="define_keywords.png" width=95% style="border:1;border-color:grey" />

After closing the edit window, you will be able to export the resulting
"custom language" into a *csv* file that you can reuse in the future by 
calling `use_custom_lang()`.

It is also possible to programmatically define one or several
keywords using `define_keywords()`. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
define_keywords(freq = "N")
```

See `?define_keywords` for more details.

# 13. <a id="setup"></a>This Vignette's Setup

Knowing how this vignette is configured can help users get started with
using **summarytools** in *Rmarkdown* documents.

### The yaml Section

The *output* element is the one what matters:

```
## ---
## output: 
##   rmarkdown::html_vignette: 
##     css: 
##     - !expr system.file("rmarkdown/templates/html_vignette/resources/vignette.css", 
##                         package = "rmarkdown")
## ---
```

### The Setup Chunk

```
## ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## library(knitr)
## opts_chunk$set(results = 'asis',      # Can also be set at the chunk-level
##                comment = NA,
##                prompt  = FALSE,
##                cache   = FALSE)
## library(summarytools)
## st_options(plain.ascii = FALSE,        # Always use this option in Rmd documents
##            style        = "rmarkdown", # Always use this option in Rmd documents
##            footnote     = NA,          # Makes html-rendered results more concise
##            subtitle.emphasis = FALSE)  # Improves layout with some rmardown themes
## ```
```

### Including **summarytools**' CSS

The needed CSS is automatically added to *html* files created
using `print()` or `view()` with the `file` argument. But in
*Rmarkdown* documents, this needs to be done explicitly:

```
## ```{r, echo=FALSE}
## st_css()
## ```
```
