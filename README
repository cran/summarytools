Transitioning from summarytools version 0.8 to 0.9
--------------------------------------------------

Although many changes were implemented since the last CRAN version of
summarytools (0.8.8), all legacy code is still supported. However, some messages
will appear from time to time, signaling changes ongoing and upcoming.

The 'omit.headings' parameter common to most functions has been replaced by
the more straightforward 'headings'. It is still boolean and serves the exact
same purpose. Simply put, headings == !omit.headings. For now, 'omit.headings' 
is still supported, but a message will be displayed in the console whenever
it is used, encouraging users to make the transition, as it will disappear in
a future release.

To simplify printing summarytools object in the console and in Rmarkdown
documents, here are three important recommendations:

1. Use stby() instead of by(). This, among other advantages,
makes obsolete the following idiom:
   
    > by_object <- by(data, indices, summarytools_function)
    > view(by_object, method = "pander")
    
   This single operation will accomplish the same thing:
   
    > stby(data, indices, summarytools_function)
    
2. Do not use lapply() with freq(); simply pass your dataframe - subsetted if
   needed - directly to freq(). That way, the printing of the output won't rely
   on view() anymore and will be totally seemless.

3. Read the two vignettes. They will show you how to use summarytools in the
   most effective way.
